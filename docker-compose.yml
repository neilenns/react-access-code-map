      # This has to be set as an arg instead of an environment variable
      # because React apps are compiled and all the environment variables
      # get hardcoded when the app is built. This gets passed
      # to the Dockerfile, which then uses it to set an ENV before
      # the build runs.
      # Solution from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/52194018
      #
      # Having to remember to make this port number match the one set up for the server is lame.
      # Someday I'll find a better way.
